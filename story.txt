I ate Brot in the Ratskeller. Then, I took a trip by train to Berlin, where I was born! I wish they had more klimaanlage over here! When I was driving down the Hauptstrasse, it came out of nowhere. An apfelkuchen flew straight at my windshield! After the initial panic, I noticed the lights turning off in the Baeckerei.
